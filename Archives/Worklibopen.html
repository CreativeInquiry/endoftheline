Speranza conductedsix free art workshops at the following Carnegie Branch Libraries: Allegheny,Beechview, Hazelwood, Homewood, Lawrenceville, and West End. The artistspublicized the workshops with <A HREF="WorkshopLibrary/invite.html">flyersand announcements</A> in each neighborhood. At the workshops, participantswere introduced to the art of collage. The artists also interviewed theparticipants on tape cassettes about important issues in their neighborhoods.From these discussions of past and present neighborhood issues and photographs,several themes emerged that were common in all neighborhoods: neighborhoodgardening, community leaders, urban removal and community-based urban renovation.The resulting five collages that recirculated back to neighborhoods on busesin May of 1997, were direct results of visual and audio materials contributedby participants at each workshop.</TD></TR></TABLE><HR></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
