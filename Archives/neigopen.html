The exciting thing about thisart project was getting to spend time in Pittsburgh neighborhoods, listeningto amazing stories of growing up in Pittsburgh often from people whose familieshave lived here for generations. For more in depth neighborhood histories,you can visit Bridging the Urban Landscape, a project of the PennsylvaniaDepartment at the Carnegie Library. Barry Chad, assistant director of thePennsylvania Department and creator of the site, was one of our collaboratorson this project.</TD></TR></TABLE><HR><BR></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
