Then the Marxistcritics, who de-emphasized the art object and emphasized the social context,and so on.</P><P>But another reason for community-based art has to do with the availabilityof funds, and the fact that if you can show community impact as a resultof your project--that is, involvement of citizens, or economic impact...</P><P>The point is that granting agencies love this because they can go tothe politicians and say &quot;here are the numbers proving this was worthwhile,&quot;and for a long time, politicians had no good way to deal with this otherthan to renew funding.</P><P>This of course is my opinion; I haven't really researched this. I havefilled out enough grant forms to know that they look for this, and I gotmyself a 501(c)3 and held it for 10 years, and had to provide the IRS withall kinds of community impact stuff. Taxes and financial law have a lotto do with this stuff.</P><P>The whole movement to get art off the wall, begun in the early yearsof this century, contained in it the notion that art could change the world.I think the community-based art movement is a manifestation of that impulse.&quot;</P><P>--Fred Truck, July 6, 1997----------------------</P><P>&quot;Congratulations for The End of The Line project. I took a lookat the Web Site. You did a great job in recruiting people to participate.The workshops and talks were very well-thought-of. What about the impacton the community? I have seen some comments (3) under &quot;neighborhoodvoices&quot;, how the community as whole is responding? What about havinga space in the site for people to post their comments? A billboard kindof thing. &nbsp; I think it is important not, only, to make public art,but to involve the public... As you both did when people started to sharetheir ideas/experiences. I am sure the project took surprising directionsafter it got started: learning for both sides (artists and community)! Thebusiness of interaction is so powerful...! &nbsp;</P><P>By the way, have you read the special report in Business Week, May 5,1997: Internet Communities. Interesting stuff!&quot;</P><P>--Petronio Bendito, June 7, 1997-------------------</P><P>&quot;Dear Lisa and Carolyn-<BR>Thanks a million for your hard work on &quot;End of the Line&quot;! Youhave really made a positive contribution to Pittsburgh neighborhoods andfeatured the real heroes of our city (those tirelessly and quietly makinga difference right where they live! Thank you for spotlighting our neighborhoodsin a positive light. I am so tired of the nihilist media perspective weso often see. Hopefully, others will want to roll up their sleeves and joinin the fun and hard work!&quot;</P><P>All the best,</P><P>--Nancy Ward Balderose, June, 1997----------------------</P><P>&quot;I went to Planning school at Pitt GSPIA. I think your project isgreat. I found it on the Pittsburgh net site on Yahoo! I hope you will havea museum exhibition as well.&quot;</P><P>-- PGHTOFTP@MSN.COM, Ft. Pierce, Florida, May 23, 1997-------------------</P><P>&quot;Had my first end of the Line sighting earlier today when drivingstudents between MCG [Manchester Craftsmen's Guild] and Pittsburgh Children'sFestival. The poster we saw featured Betty Rosfeld (?) who distributed rationcoupons to her neighbor's in Beechview. One of the girls I was driving wentto elementary school in that neighborhood and made an immediate connectionwith the piece through that personal history. Congratulations on a greatproject. I'll keep my eyes on the busses.&quot;<BR><BR>--Joshua Green, May 15, 1997-------------------</P><P>&quot;I write a column called 'on the bus with kat hy jo' i think busesare the last hope for humanity. where people, strangers, get to talk toeach other. or at least try. my columns have to appeal to a smarmy intellectualreadership but have been endeared (or maybe endured) by so many people.it's just that i see so much &quot;art&quot; in the interactions with peopleon the b us. i truly love my fellow bus riders. and I've yet to rip on abus driver even though they can be brutal. &nbsp;</P><P>anyway. that's all about that. &nbsp;</P><P>i guess so many &quot;artists&quot; are usually so high freaking class,that to even ride a bus is a political act for them. I'm glad t o see normalpeople involved. But the poetry on the bus project was so full of p poetrythat no one on the bus would understand or even care about, that it's insulting.So, as far as the impact of art on my life, I've seen none. NONE. becauseyou can tell for the most part, that it's done for the artists' benefit,to put on a resume or some shit, and not for the people it supposedly isto serve. &quot;</P><P>--Kathy Jo Kramer, May 13,1997-------------------</P><P><HR ALIGN=LEFT><TABLE WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="67" BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TD WIDTH="447" BGCOLOR="#b9b9b9" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="CENTER"><B><A HREF="ProjectFeedback.html">Add Your Comments to this Site!</A></B></TD></TR><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#858585" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="CENTER"><B><A HREF="../index.html">Home Page</A> | <A HREF="../Voices/VoicesLeader.html">NeighborhoodVoices</A> | <A HREF="../Archives/ArchivesFrames.html">Library WorkshopArchives</A> |<A HREF="../Archives/ArchivesFrames.html"> </A><A HREF="../RelatedSites/Sites.html">RelatedSites</A> | <A HREF="../Project/ProjectIntro.html">Project Documentation</A></B></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
