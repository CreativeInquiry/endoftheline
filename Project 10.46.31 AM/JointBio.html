They worked with five students from the ManchesterCraftsmen's Guild's Arts Apprenticeship Training Program to create a twentyby thirty foot digital image printed on vinyl, &quot;Literacy Windows,&quot;which is currently on view at the Goodwill bookstore on East Carson Streetin Pittsburgh's Southside. The mural addresses the theme of literacy andinvolved community research and interviews on this topic. This project wasreviewed by the New Art Examiner as well as by local publications and televisionstations. Lisa and Carolyn also co-authored an article about &quot;LiteracyWindows&quot; titled A Public Computer Image in Pittsburgh: Literacy Windowsfor ART COM electronic journal published on the Internet.</P><P>In 1994, Lisa and Carolyn worked together again to create a billboarddisplay, &quot;It Makes My Bread Sweeter&quot; for the urban revitalizationproject &quot;Community+Art = Adopting Aliquippa.&quot; For this project,the artists researched Aliquippa history both in the library and throughdiscussions with members of the community. They designed an image that celebratedthe &quot;unsung hero,&quot; Mario Ezzo, an ordinary citizen of Depressionera Aliquippa who contributed unselfishly to improve his urban environment.This billboard was displayed both on Aliquippa's main street, Franklin Avenue,and on a side road across from the town church.</P><P>In support of their work, Lisa and Carolyn have recently been made Fellowsat Carnegie Mellon University's STUDIO for Creative Inquiry. &quot;End ofthe Line,&quot; has received a New Forms Regional Grant.(NEA, Pa Councilon the Arts, Warhol and Rockefeller Foundations)</P><P>Lisa Link has a lifelong dedication for historic research and visualanalysis.
