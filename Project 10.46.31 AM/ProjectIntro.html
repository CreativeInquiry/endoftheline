Art is leaving the salon formore publicly accessible electronic networks, community operated cable TV,billboards, neighborhood gardens and subway systems. More and more, artistsare leaving their century old position at the edge of the avant-garde foran open-eyed, responsible, collaborative role within their culture. Fundingis shifting towards art projects with social service goals.</P><P>Several issues emerge from these trends. One concern is how much an artisttoday is expected to be a social worker. Another is if an art project hasspecific start and end dates, what happens to the relationship between artistand community when the artist leaves? Added to these challenges is how muchtime the most dedicated artist can feasibly volunteer to realize the fullpotential of a community-based artwork. All of us, including our assistantDebra Tomson, maintained full-time paid jobs in addition to the hundredsof hours we volunteered over one year to complete &quot;End of the Line.&quot;</P><P>In the course of our summer library workshops, we found a strong desireamong young people and senior citizens for a creative outlet and individualrecognition. Yet, we only had time and funding to go to six of thirteeninterested neighborhood libraries for workshops.</P><P>We are hosting a press conference at a downtown bus stop and an open-houseat the STUDIO for Creative Inquiry at Carnegie Mellon University to reunitecommunity participants with the project after an intensive period of production.At these events we will acknowledge everyone's contribution and explainhow their images fit into the overall structure of the project. We willalso introduce the web site.</P><P>Questions linger - can these one-time projects, successful as they maybe, truly replace the huge cutbacks that we are witnessing in the arts acrossthe United States? What implications do temporary art projects or lack ofart in public education have on the next generation who might grow up withoutart? As a democratic society, we are collectively making decisions thatwill effect our creative consciousness far into the next century.</P><P>&quot;End of the Line&quot; is a community-based artistic collaborationexamining historic and contemporary issues in Pittsburgh's neighborhoods&shy; resulting in the creation of five computer collages displayed on twentyPAT buses for the duration of one month. We designed &quot;End of the Line&quot;as a project that crosses boundaries between Pittsburgh neighborhoods, bothin the unifying themes of the visual designs and in the designs' means ofdisplay on public buses and the World Wide Web. This project presents bothour passion for the computer as an artistic tool and our commitment to sharingour art and working process with a broad audience. Last summer, we createdpartnerships with six neighborhoods through workshops held at Carnegie branchlibraries. We met many enthusiastic librarians who generously contributedtheir time to making the neighborhood collage/oral history workshops possible.They reinforced our belief in the public library system as one of the fewtruly democratic institutions left in many areas of the United States.</P><P>It was inspiring and educational to meet so many people who have livedin our region for generations and to hear their stories. We are gratefulfor their willingness to share their ideas and photographs for a publicart project. Condensing so much material into four collages without loweringour design standards was very challenging. Our solution was to create afifth design, a poster that includes images of the libraries and workshops,paying visual homage to the location and process of generating the fourcomputer collages for the twenty exterior bus billboards. In the digitalspace of the web site, we found the flexibility to include an archive ofimages and text not possible within the physical confines of the printedbillboard collages.</P><P>We appreciate everyone's support for public art which recognizes individualcivic achievement, community issues and local history presented in an alternativevisual format. A large community-based project depends on many people tolend their time and creative input. Debra Tomson, our artist assistant,diligently attended workshops and helped produce our web site. Barry Chad,Assistant Director of the Pennsylvania Department at the Carnegie Libraryprovided invaluable research. At Carnegie Mellon University, Marge Myers,Assistant Director at the STUDIO for Creative Inquiry, lent guidance andexperiential wisdom to the project while Diana Bajzek and John Scott Thorburnat TELab made computer access and production possible. Of the many neighborhoodgroups, the Lawrenceville Historical Society and YouthBuild, Pittsburgh,Inc. of Homewood were especially helpful in providing materials. We wouldespecially like to acknowledge the six librarians: Joyce Broadus (Homewood),Marlene Demarest (Westend), Cheryl Engel (Hazelwood), Connie Galbraith andMarshall Webster (Allegheny Regional), Mildred Glenn (Lawrenceville), andMarian Streiff (Beechview) whose partnership made our neighborhood researchpossible.</P><P>Lisa B.
