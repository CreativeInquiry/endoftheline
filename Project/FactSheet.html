These themes were developedthrough workshops that Ms. Link &amp; Ms. Speranza led at six Carnegie Branchlibraries in the summer of 1996. Participants contributed their oral historiesand photographs to the project and were taught how to make collages by theartists. During the fall of 1996, the artists further refined the projectwith additional visits to each neighborhood and meetings with workshop participants.The artists then assembled the five digital collages in the computer andcreated the project's web site from the project's archive during the winterand spring of 1997.</P><P><B>Duration: </B><BR>April 1996 - August 1997. <BR>Digital collages in transit on 20 PAT buses, May 1 - August 1, 1997. <BR>Interactive Web site on-line beginning May 15, 1997.</P><P><B>Participating Carnegie Libraries: </B>Allegheny Regional, Beechview,Hazelwood, Homewood, Lawrenceville, West End, the Pennsylvania Departmentin Oakland.</P><P><B>Format:</B><BR>Four 21&quot; x 72&quot; digital collages electrostatically printed andlaminated on vinyl mounted on exterior rear billboard area of 20 PAT buses.</P><P>Offset 21&quot; x 22&quot; color posters mounted on interior of 20 PATTransit buses and in public areas in the city of Pittsburgh.</P><P>One web site http://www.pittsburgh.net/End_of_the_Line</P><P><B>Project Contributions and Support:</B><BR>Funding through the New Forms Regional Grant Program administered by thePainted Bride, funded by the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts InterdisciplinaryArts Program, the National Endowment for the Arts/Inter-Arts Program, theRockefeller Foundation and the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual ArtsInc.</P><P>Technical and production support, printing consultation contributed by<A HREF="http://www.cmu.edu/acs/telab/">TELab (Technology Enhanced LearningLab)</A>, Carnegie Mellon University.</P><P>Supported by the STUDIO for Creative Inquiry, Carnegie Mellon University.</P><P>Web site housing courtesy of <A HREF="http://www.netservices.com/">InternetServices, Corp</A>.</P><P><B>Design Themes:<BR>I. Four Exterior Computer Collages</B><BR>Urban Removal: A strong theme that emerged from our interviews at libraryworkshops is the impact of large road and building projects on Pittsburgh'sresidential neighborhoods. Even the threat of such construction is enoughto deflate housing values and send an area into decline. People spoke ofthe horrors that noise, debris, dislocation and permanent disruption highwayconstruction can have on their community. These projects clearly serve theinterests of suburban and outlying populations at the expense of city residents.</P><P>Urban Rebuilding: The flip side to &quot;urban removal&quot; is the pro-activestance that neighborhood groups are taking to improve the physical conditionsof buildings in their areas. Through their efforts many dedicated workerscounteract the media stereotypes of the inner-city neighborhood as a placeof danger, apathy and physical decay. Their projects range in size and scaleand many organizations, such as Youthbuild based in Homewood, have socialmissions such as training and educating young people, that allow them toimpact the community beyond just renovating old homes.</P><P>Community Gardens: There are numerous community gardens that sustainthe aesthetic and culinary needs of Pittsburgh's city residents. They aremaintained by hundreds of volunteer gardeners. We found several garden basedbeautification projects located in small areas adjacent to PAT bus stops.Garden enthusiasts can also meditate on the artwork and architectural remnantsin the beds of the Olde Allegheny Garden Society or catch scenic views ofthe Northside between ears of corn in a community vegetable garden on theslopes of Polish Hill.</P><P>Local Heroes: At every workshop we heard stories of the unsung heroesof Pittsburgh, the people whose daily contribution to their fellow Pittsburghersmade their neighborhood a positive place to live. Although most of thesepeople will never get a statue in their honor or a bank to bear their name,we feel it is critical to acknowledge their role in building their communities.We feature one such person, Ruth Rosfeld, as a symbol of the numerous individualswhose civic excellence truly illustrates the motto of Pittsburgh as &quot;America'sMost Livable city.&quot;</P><P><B>II. Interior Computer Collage</B><BR>Our announcement poster celebrates the six participating libraries as centersof their neighborhoods and doorways to knowledge. Images also honor thecommunity workshop process whereby many individuals contributed stories,images and time to the &quot;End of the Line&quot; art project.<BR><BR><HR ALIGN=LEFT><TABLE WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="67" BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="2"CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TD WIDTH="447" BGCOLOR="#b9b9b9" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="CENTER"><B><A HREF="ProjectIntro.html">Introduction and Context</A> | <A HREF="Images/ProjectImages.html">BusBillboard Collages</A> | <A HREF="BusBillboards/FourBuses.html">The Buses</A>| <A HREF="PressConference/ConferenceFrame.html">Press Conference</A> |<A HREF="Participants.html">Community Participant Listing</A> | <A HREF="JointBio.html">Artists' Biography</A> | <A HREF="Funders.html">Fundersand Sponsors</A></B></TD></TR><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#858585" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="CENTER"><B><A HREF="../index.html">Home Page</A> | <A HREF="../Voices/VoicesGardening.html">NeighborhoodVoices</A> | <A HREF="../Archives/ArchivesFrames.html">Library WorkshopArchives</A> | <A HREF="../Feedback/ProjectFeedback.html">Your Participation</A>| <A HREF="../Feedback/PublicResponse.html">Public Response</A> | <A HREF="../RelatedSites/Sites.html">Related Sites</A></B></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
