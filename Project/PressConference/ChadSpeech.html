ThePennsylvania Department at the Main Branch of Carnegie Library of Pittsburghspecializes in genealogy, the study of one's family roots, and in localhistory. We are happy to have been able to share what amounts to only ahandful of photos from the Pennsylvania Department's permanent and premierecollection of over 70,000 historic images of Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania.And, aside from our photos, the Department has extensive historic materialssuch as World War II ration coupons which were also used in the End of theLine project.</P><P>The core of the collection is the Pittsburgh Photographic Library whichdocuments the transition of Pittsburgh from the smoky city of the 1940sto the livable city that it is today. Nationally-known photographers representedare Esther Bubley, Harold Corsini, Clyde Hare and Richard Saunders amongothers.</P><P>It has been said that Pittsburgh must have been laid out by a billy goat.Its geography is the principal reason for its many bridges and one of thechief reasons for the unique character of its many neighborhoods and theproliferation of Carnegie Library branches throughout the city.</P><P>The technology of the digital scanner and of the internet now makes itpossible to break down these borders and share the traditions, heritageand history that have accumulated over decades. Family and historic photographsnow take on a new life when scanned, digitized and displayed on a cathoderay tube. With the ability to enhance images, faces, words and details long-obscuredand forgotten can now spring to life and what was lost can be reclaimedas the foundation of a Pittsburgh entering the 21st century.</P><P>The Pennsylvania Department, Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, is happyto have played a part.<BR>--Barry Chad, Assistant Head, Pennsylvania Department.</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
