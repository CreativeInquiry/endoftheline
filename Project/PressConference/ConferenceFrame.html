You have reached the "End of the Line" Library Workshop Archives.  "End of the Line" is a public art project that crossed neighborhood boundaries through the visual placement of unifying cultural themes on Pittsburgh buses.  
<p>The artists, Carolyn Speranza and Lisa Link, examined contemporary issues in Pittsburgh neighborhoods in their workshops at Carnegie Public Libraries.  They visualized their findings with digital collages, printed them on vinyl and displayed them throughout SouthWestern Pennsylvania using transit advertising slots on the public bus system.
<p>
This web site provides a comprehensive presentation of the project with the inclusion of the collages, project documentation, public response, and archives from the library workshops.
