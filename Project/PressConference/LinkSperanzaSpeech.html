This is Lisa Link and I am Carolyn Speranza.We are the artist co-authors of End of the Line art project and we'd liketo welcome you to this &quot;kick off&quot; event.</P><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><B>Lis</B>a: &quot;End of the Line&quot; is a series of collages on  the exterior of twenty PAT buses and a poster honoring the six participating  neighborhood Libraries.

People brought in photographs  from their neighborhoods and told us amazing stories.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Carolyn:</B> Visiting these neighborhoods and listening to residents,we found common themes and concerns and they were: Rebuilding the community,Urban removal, Community gardens, Community heroes, and the importance ofPittsburgh's Libraries.</P><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><B>Lisa:</B> We assembled the actual collages about these themes using  computer imaging technology. We printed them on vinyl.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Carolyn:</B> We really admire other cities that have strong art inpublic transit programs and wanted to do the same thing here in Pittsburgh.</P><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><B>Lisa:</B> We chose the bus as method of display because buses go  out to the neighborhoods and cross geographic boundaries. The buses bring  the images back to the people who helped make them.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Carolyn:</B> Here you see the &quot;Urban Rebuilding&quot; collagewhich combines images from the different neighborhoods.
