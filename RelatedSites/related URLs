Ihad a hard time finding links that had community participation with apublic art project.  Here are some web sites though that are possibilities:(http://www. will be a given in all of these) 1.) bc.edu/bc org/avp/cas/fnart/cooper.html 2.) latino.sscnet.ucla.edu/mural/index1.html 3.) arts.ohio-state.edu/ArtEducation/kplayground/welcome.html 4.) mainquad.com/collage/aboutindex.html 5.) it-center.se/casmoinfo/Sidor/sida 2.html 6.) tmn.com/iop/index.html 7.) best.com/~jantypas/aicap/archive/intro.html then some sites to access other public art 8.) zpub.com/public 9.) artswire.org/highperf/APIhome.html 10.) culturenet.ucalgary.ca/metror/public_art.htmlSue
