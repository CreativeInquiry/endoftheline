These collages are designed to cross boundaries between neighborhoods symbolicallyin their unifying cultural themes and literally in their method of displayon PAT buses and placement on the World Wide Web. These themes were developedthrough workshops that Ms. Link &amp; Ms. Speranza led at six Carnegie Branchlibraries in the summer of 1996. Participants contributed their oral historiesand photographs to the project and were taught how to make collages by theartists. During the fall of 1996, the artists further refined the projectwith additional visits to each neighborhood and meetings with workshop participants.The artists then assembled the five digital collages in the computer andcreated the project's web site from the project's archive during the winterand spring of 1997.</TD></TR><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#dfc641"><script language="javascript"><!--//check if the browser is Navigator 3 or higher:agent = navigator.userAgent;browserVer = 2;if (agent.substring(0,7) == "Mozilla"){    if (parseInt(agent.substring(8,9)) >= 3) {browserVer = 1;}}// display the font size appropriately for platform differencesif(browserVer == 1){			if (navigator.appVersion.indexOf("Mac") > 1){                document.write('<basefont size="3">');        }else{                document.write('<basefont size="2">');        }}// -->		</script><CENTER><font size= -1><B><A HREF="Project/BusBillboards/FourBuses.html">The Buses</A>| <A HREF="Project/Images/ProjectImages.html">Bus Billboard Collages</A>| <A HREF="Voices/VoicesRebuilding.html">Neighborhood Voices</A> | <A HREF="Project/ProjectIntro.html">Project Documentation</A> | <A HREF="Archives/ArchivesFrames.html">LibraryWorkshop Archives</A> | <A HREF="Project/PressConference/ConferenceFrame.html">PressConference</A> | <A HREF="Feedback/ProjectFeedback.html">Your Participation</A>| <A HREF="Feedback/PublicResponse.html">Public Response</A> | <A HREF="RelatedSites/Sites.html">Related Sites</A></B></font></CENTER></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
